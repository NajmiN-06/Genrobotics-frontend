## 🔧 Enhancements by Me
This project includes custom enhancements I implemented to elevate the user experience and showcase frontend polish:

- **Scroll-triggered card animations**:  
  Three informational cards animate into view with alternating directions (left → right → left) as the user scrolls, adding visual rhythm and engagement.

- **Current Openings section**:  
  Job cards dynamically render with job details and background images. Each card animates into view on scroll, and a “View More” button inserts an additional job card with full styling and animation.
